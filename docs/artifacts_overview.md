# Artifacts Overview

This document gives a short engineering overview of the current project artifacts.

## Python Scripts

- `src/data/analyze_data.py` reads `Matches.csv` and `EloRatings.csv`, builds table schemas, missing-value reports, league/season coverage reports, and confirms the selected top-5 league slice for 2018/19-2024/25.
- `src/data/clean_data.py` filters top-5 leagues, removes rows with critical missing values, checks duplicates, teams, and ELO coverage, and synchronizes ELO by the latest available rating date `<= MatchDate`.
- `src/features/feature_registry.py` stores centralized feature lists: base features, ELO features, odds features, rolling v1 features, target columns, and leakage columns.
- `src/features/build_features.py` builds `matches_features_v1.csv`: ELO/odds features, simple rolling goals/form features, and target columns. Rolling features use historical context before 2018/19, while the final dataset remains limited to 2018/19-2024/25.

## CSV Datasets

- `data/raw/Matches.csv` is the source match table: leagues, dates, teams, ELO, form, odds, results, and post-match statistics.
- `data/raw/EloRatings.csv` is the source ELO table: rating date, club, country, and rating.
- `data/interim/matches_top5_2018_2025_clean.csv` is the cleaned working slice for top-5 leagues in 2018/19-2024/25 with verified ELO coverage.
- `data/interim/matches_features_v1.csv` is the v1 feature dataset for future model training. Post-match leakage columns are not included as features.

Files under `data/` are not committed because they are local or potentially large generated artifacts.

## Reports

- `reports/tables/matches_schema.csv` contains the `Matches.csv` schema: types, missing values, and unique counts.
- `reports/tables/elo_schema.csv` contains the `EloRatings.csv` schema.
- `reports/tables/matches_missing_values.csv` contains missing values by column for the full `Matches.csv`.
- `reports/tables/elo_missing_values.csv` contains missing values by column for the full `EloRatings.csv`.
- `reports/tables/division_season_coverage.csv` contains league and season coverage.
- `reports/tables/top5_2018_2025_scope_summary.csv` summarizes the selected working slice.
- `reports/tables/top5_2018_2025_missing_values.csv` contains missing values for key columns in the selected slice.
- `reports/tables/cleaning_quality_report.csv` records cleaning quality checks: rows, duplicates, dates, teams, and ELO coverage.
- `reports/tables/features_v1_report.csv` records final feature dataset checks: rows, columns, missing values, and historical context size for rolling features.

## Leakage Policy

v1 features do not include current-match results or statistics: `FTHome`, `FTAway`, `FTResult`, `HT*`, shots, fouls, corners, or cards. These fields are used only to create target columns and rolling features with `shift(1)`.
